# Portal Gun - Rootstrap ðŸ¥’ (It's a pickle)

ðŸ‘‹ Hey Rootstrap, it's [Juan Ma](https://juanmamigliore.com/). I couldn't make it through the Challenge, so here I go again.


## What happened in the challenge?


I ran out of time. I noticed that the project used Next.js, but it mentioned that it wasn't strictly necessary, so I initially started developing it as a client-side project, but later I thought: *"This might be a trap..."* and began incorporating Next.js features into the development. 

I couldn't make it,  I ran out of time and what I delivered does not meet either my expectations nor yours.

## Second chances

I believe in second chances, and maybe you do too. Bad beginnings don't necessarily lead to a bad relationship

## The Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

### For running it locally

```bash
npm i
# and
npm run dev

```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Live project

https://portal-gun-rootstrap.vercel.app/

### GitHub link (to have it handy)

### Decisions

- **`Next.js@latest`**: I decided to use Next.js to get the best of both worlds: client and server-side rendering, along with Next.js features like caching, image optimization, layouts, loaders, SEO, and more.
- **`Query Params`**: If you want to share a specific page, you can do so because I make use of query parameters for fetching the data. 
- **`GraphQL`**: The API supports it. It speeds up the response time and allows fetching only the necessary data.
- **`SSR`**: Depending on the project, it might be a must. Better SEO, faster initial load, A11y, scalable.
- **`A11y`**: A bit optimized for screen readers
- **`SEO`**: A bit of SEO
- **`Eslint & Formatters`**: To keep everything neat

## Some explanations

### Metadata
I use some metadata: titles, descriptions, and the Open Graph (OG) and Twitter images.

On the detail page, youâ€™ll see that Iâ€™ve commented out the `generateMetadata` function, which creates dynamic metadata. If this were a real project, it would be a must-have, but thereâ€™s an issue with this function and the loading state. `generateMetadata` blocks the UI rendering until the data is available, which causes the fallback in Suspense to take longer to appear, resulting in a poor UX. That's why I decided to use the static function instead.

**What would I do?**
It depends on the project, but my options would be:
- A specific endpoint for metadata, probably making good use of caching to ensure a fast response.
- A static file, generated by a cron job that runs at intervals to gather all the characters/posts/whatever exists on the website.
- Not-so-fancy option: I would resolve the loading issue client-side as soon as a route change is detected.

### Query Params

In the main page where all the characters are mixed, when we change pages, I use `/?name=&page=2`, leaving the `name` undefined because the GraphQL query allows it.

### Pagination

You can have thousands of results, and the pagination will still work.

### Lighthouse
I know it's a small challange, but I do run lighthouse in all of my projects:

## Final words

Not convinced? What about another challenge? No matter your decision, thanks for your time.

I will make the repo private in short, so not to index your challange.
